/**
 * @brief An enum type representing different ways to monitor the user's location
 *
 * @discussion Location monitoring in iOS can be done with multiple strategies:
 *  - continuous (ACPPlacesMonitorModeContinuous) - the monitor will receive and process location updates once per second.
 *    Using this monitoring strategy consumes a lot power. For more information, see:
 *    https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1423750-startupdatinglocation
 *  - significant changes (ACPPlacesMonitorModeSignificantChanges) - the monitor will only receive and process location
 *    updates when the device has moved a significant distance from the last time its location was processed.
 *    Using this monitoring strategy consumes far less power than continuous monitoring.  For more information, see:
 *    https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1423531-startmonitoringsignificantlocati

};

/**
 * @class ACPPlacesMonitor
 *
 * The ACPPlacesMonitor handles OS-level management of tracking the user's location and region monitoring.  It works
 * in conjunction with the ACPPlaces extension in the Adobe Experience Platform SDK:
 * https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks
 *
 * If you are doing background location monitoring in your app, you will need to enable the application's capability to
 * update locations while the app is in the background.  More information can be found here:
 * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_the_user_s_location/handling_location_events_in_the_background?language=objc
 *
 * Before iOS will ask the user for permission to use GPS capabilities, you must provide a description of why your app
 * requires device location.  The description should be entered in your Info.plist file.  More information found here:
 * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_authorization_level_for_location_services/requesting_always_authorization?language=objc
